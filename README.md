# CLT-RShiny
An RShiny dashboard to visualize Central Limit Theorem in action
Users can choose the original population distribution to be from one among the 6 common probability distributions, draw samples from the population and manipulate the sample size and the number of samples to visualize the sampling distribution of the sample means. Regardless of the original distribution being normal or not, the sampling distribution of the sample means always approximate towards a normal distribution when the sample size as well as the number of samples are sufficiently high. This is a remarkable property that has helped inferential statistics (for example, in randomized controlled trials to evaluate treatment effects) a lot.
